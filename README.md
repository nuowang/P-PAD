# P-PAD
Reinforcement learning on [Puzzle & Dragons](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.gungho.padEN).

The project is still evolving but currently we are trying:
* Boltzmann policy and annealing.
* Experience replay.
* A frozen model B for action reward prediction.

### Random sampling

### Generating training data from solved boards
Examples of solved boards:
